## 1. Who We Are

WeSpot is operated by **WeSpot Labs, Inc.** (“WeSpot,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). We provide a safety and location-sharing application that helps trusted groups stay connected while respecting privacy. The App is intended for adults and other users who meet the minimum age requirements described in this Policy and in the Google Play listing.

This Privacy Policy explains how WeSpot collects, uses, and safeguards personal information when you use the WeSpot Android application and related services (collectively, the “App”). If you disagree with any part of this Privacy Policy, please discontinue using the App.

## 2. Information We Collect

| Category | Details | How it is collected | Control |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account data | Email, password hash, display name, profile image | When you create or update your account | Required to create an account |
| Safety & contact data | Trusted contacts, safe zones, optional medical notes | When you configure safety features | You can add, edit, or delete this data at any time |
| Location data | Current GPS coordinates, geofence events, selected retention of history | Only when you enable location tracking or safety features | Controlled via Privacy Settings → “Allow location tracking” |
| Driving & device telemetry | Motion sensor data for crash detection, speed data, battery level | Only when you opt in to driving safety or battery monitoring | Controlled via dedicated toggles in Privacy Settings |
| Communications | SOS messages, group notifications, chat history | When you use in-app messaging or sharing | You can delete conversations and revoke sharing |
| Diagnostics | Crash logs, performance metrics | Only when you opt in to crash reporting or analytics | Controlled via Privacy Settings |

We do **not** sell personal information or ingest social media data.

## 3. How We Use Information

We process personal information to:

1. **Provide the App** – authenticate you, sync trusted contacts, share live locations you request, deliver emergency alerts, and send push notifications you subscribe to.  
2. **Keep you safe** – monitor geofences you configure, process SOS messages, detect severe driving events, notify trusted contacts of low battery or crashes (only when you enable these features).  
3. **Improve reliability** – if you opt in to anonymous analytics, we analyze feature usage, device types, and performance to improve the experience.  
4. **Diagnose problems** – if you opt in to Crashlytics, we collect crash logs to fix issues.  
5. **Comply with the law** – handle legal obligations, enforce our terms, and respond to lawful requests.

Legal bases: **Consent** (for analytics, crash reporting, voice SOS, driving and battery monitoring), **Contract** (to deliver the service you request), **Legitimate interest** (to secure accounts and prevent abuse), and **Legal obligation** (for record keeping and legal compliance).

## 4. Privacy Controls in the App

You have granular control inside **Settings → Privacy Settings**:

- **Allow essential data collection** – required for sign-in, securing the service, and syncing trusted contacts.  
- **Share anonymous analytics** – off by default. When off, analytics data is not collected.  
- **Send crash reports** – optional. When off, Crashlytics identifiers are cleared and no crash data is collected.  
- **Allow location tracking** – toggles live and background location updates, geofencing, and Android background jobs.  
- **Enable driving safety monitoring** – optional. Requires location tracking and device motion sensors.  
- **Share low-battery alerts** – optional. Stops sending battery telemetry when off.  
- **Enable voice SOS detection** – optional. When off, the microphone is not used for keyword detection.  
- **Data retention** – choose how long location history is stored (30, 90, 180, 365, 730, or 1095 days). Default is 12 months.

Changes take effect immediately and are stored securely on your device and in your profile.

---

## 5. How We Share Information

We share personal information only in these circumstances:

- **Trusted contacts** you designate – live location, selected history, arrival/departure alerts, crash or SOS notifications, and low-battery warnings.  
- **Service providers** – Firebase (Google), Google Cloud Platform, Android WorkManager, Google Maps Platform, Google Play Billing. These providers act on our behalf under contracts that require them to safeguard your data.  
- **Legal disclosures** – if required by law or to protect users, suspected victims, or WeSpot.  
- **Business transfers** – in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, provided the new entity honors this policy.  

We do **not** sell personal information or share it with advertising networks without your explicit consent.

---

## 6. Data Security

We protect your information using:

- TLS 1.2+ encryption for all network traffic.  
- Firebase security rules and access controls on cloud data.  
- AES-based encryption for local caches and notification payloads stored on your device.  
- Immediate clearing of Crashlytics/Analytics identifiers when consent is revoked.  
- Restricted access to production systems with audit logging.

While we strive for industry-grade security, no system is completely immune to vulnerabilities. We continuously monitor and improve our safeguards.

## 7. Data Retention & Deletion

| Data Type | Retention | How to manage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location history | According to your selected retention period (default 365 days) | Edit retention in Privacy Settings, delete history, or delete your account |
| SOS and place alerts | Up to 24 months unless you remove them sooner | Delete alerts in the App or delete your account |
| Account/profile info | Until you close your account | Delete account in Privacy Settings |
| Telemetry (analytics/crash) | Only while toggles are enabled | Disable toggles to stop future collection |
| Local device caches | Encrypted; cleared automatically when you sign out or delete your account | Sign out or delete account |

**Export your data:** Privacy Settings → “Export my data” creates an encrypted JSON archive you control.  
**Delete account & data:** Privacy Settings → “Delete account & data.” We disable services, delete Firestore collections, remove Firebase Storage files, clear encrypted local caches, revoke push tokens, and request Firebase Authentication to remove your user account. Minimal information may be retained if required by law (e.g., fraud prevention logs).

## 8. Age Requirements & Children’s Privacy

WeSpot is designed for **adults (18 years and older)**. Users who are under 18 should not download or use the App. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors, and we request that parents or guardians ensure that children do not access the App. If you believe WeSpot has inadvertently collected data from a minor, please contact us immediately and we will delete it promptly.

We store data in the United States and may process it in other countries where our processors operate. We rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and equivalent safeguards required by applicable law. By using the App, you acknowledge that your data may be processed outside your country of residence.

## 10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)

California residents have the right to know what personal information we collect, request deletion or correction, and opt out of “sales” or “sharing” (WeSpot does neither). Exercise these rights via the in-app Privacy Settings or by contacting us. We do not discriminate against users who exercise their rights.

## 11. European Economic Area & United Kingdom

If you are located in the EEA or UK, you may exercise GDPR/UK GDPR rights—access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection, and withdrawal of consent—via the App or by contacting us.
