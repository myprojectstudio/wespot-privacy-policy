        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information or ingest social media data.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We process personal information to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Provide the App</strong> – authenticate you, sync trusted contacts, share live locations you request, deliver emergency alerts, and send push notifications you subscribe to.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep you safe</strong> – monitor geofences you configure, process SOS messages, detect severe driving events, notify trusted contacts of low battery or crashes (only when you enable these features).</li>
            <li><strong>Manage subscriptions</strong> – verify purchases, provide premium features, process renewals, and handle cancellations through app store providers.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve reliability</strong> – if you opt in to anonymous analytics, we analyze feature usage, device types, and performance to improve the experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnose problems</strong> – if you opt in to Crashlytics, we collect crash logs to fix issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Comply with the law</strong> – handle legal obligations, enforce our terms, and respond to lawful requests.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Legal bases: <strong>Consent</strong> (for analytics, crash reporting, voice SOS, driving and battery monitoring), <strong>Contract</strong> (to deliver the service you request), <strong>Legitimate interest</strong> (to secure accounts and prevent abuse), and <strong>Legal obligation</strong> (for record keeping and legal compliance).</p>

        <h2>4. Location Data and Retention</h2>
        <p>Location data is a core feature of WeSpot. We handle it as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We only collect location data when you explicitly enable location sharing in the app settings.</li>
            <li>Location data is shared only with trusted contacts you've explicitly added to your network.</li>
            <li>You can stop sharing your location at any time through Privacy Settings.</li>
            <li>Location history is stored securely using industry-standard encryption.</li>
            <li>You can delete your location history at any time through Privacy Settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Location data retention varies by subscription tier:</strong></p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Subscription Tier</th>
                    <th>Location History Retention</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Free</td>
                    <td>3 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shield ($7.99/month)</td>
                    <td>30 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Guardian ($15.99/month)</td>
                    <td>90 days</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Circle ($25.99/month)</td>
                    <td>365 days</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>When your subscription expires or you downgrade, location history beyond your new tier's retention period will be automatically deleted. You can also manually delete location history at any time, regardless of your subscription tier.</p>

        <h2>5. Subscription and Payment Data</h2>
        <p>When you purchase a subscription through WeSpot:</p>

            <li>Payment transactions are handled entirely by the app store provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Subscription Information We Store:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscription tier (Free, Shield, Guardian, or Circle)</li>

            <li>To verify your subscription status and provide access to premium features</li>
            <li>To manage subscription renewals and cancellations</li>
            <li>To prevent fraud and unauthorized access using Play Integrity API (Android) or similar verification systems</li>
            <li>To provide customer support related to subscriptions</li>
            <li>To comply with legal and tax obligations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Storage:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscription information is stored in Firebase with encryption at rest.</li>
            <li>We use Play Integrity API (Android) to verify purchases and prevent fraud.</li>
            <li>Subscription data is retained for as long as your account is active, plus any period required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your Rights:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can cancel your subscription at any time through your app store account settings.</li>
            <li>Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period.</li>
            <li>You can restore previous purchases through the app's "Restore Purchases" feature.</li>
            <li>You can request a copy of your subscription data through Privacy Settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Privacy Controls in the App</h2>
        <p>You have granular control inside <strong>Settings → Privacy Settings</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Allow essential data collection</strong> – required for sign-in, securing the service, and syncing trusted contacts.</li>
            <li><strong>Share anonymous analytics</strong> – off by default. When off, analytics data is not collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Send crash reports</strong> – optional. When off, Crashlytics identifiers are cleared and no crash data is collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Allow location tracking</strong> – toggles live and background location updates, geofencing, and Android background jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable driving safety monitoring</strong> – optional. Requires location tracking and device motion sensors.</li>
            <li><strong>Share low-battery alerts</strong> – optional. Stops sending battery telemetry when off.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable voice SOS detection</strong> – optional. When off, the microphone is not used for keyword detection.</li>
            <li><strong>Data retention</strong> – choose how long location history is stored (30, 90, 180, 365, 730, or 1095 days). Default is 12 months. Note: Your subscription tier may limit the maximum retention period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changes take effect immediately and are stored securely on your device and in your profile.</p>

        <h2>7. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We share personal information only in these circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trusted contacts</strong> you designate – live location, selected history, arrival/departure alerts, crash or SOS notifications, and low-battery warnings.</li>
            <li><strong>Service providers</strong> – Firebase (Google), Google Cloud Platform, Android WorkManager, Google Maps Platform, Google Play Billing. These providers act on our behalf under contracts that require them to safeguard your data.</li>
            <li><strong>App store providers</strong> – Google Play Store and Apple App Store for subscription management, purchase verification, and payment processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal disclosures</strong> – if required by law or to protect users, suspected victims, or WeSpot.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency services</strong> – when you use SOS features, we may share your location with emergency services as required to facilitate emergency response.</li>
            <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> – in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, provided the new entity honors this policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information or share it with advertising networks without your explicit consent.</p>

        <p>These services have their own privacy policies. We ensure all third-party services comply with data protection standards and are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data.</p>
        <p>We currently do <strong>not</strong> distribute WeSpot on Apple platforms. If that changes, we will update this section and notify you.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We protect your information using:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TLS 1.2+ encryption for all network traffic.</li>
            <li>Firebase security rules and access controls on cloud data.</li>
            <li>AES-based encryption for local caches and notification payloads stored on your device.</li>
            <li>Immediate clearing of Crashlytics/Analytics identifiers when consent is revoked.</li>
            <li>Restricted access to production systems with audit logging.</li>
            <li>Play Integrity API verification for subscription purchases to prevent fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we strive for industry-grade security, no system is completely immune to vulnerabilities. We continuously monitor and improve our safeguards.</p>
